They may be unused, or they were accessed by direct calls to .forward() or via other python methods. In the latter case they will have zeros for statistics, though their statistics will still contribute to their parent calling module.conv1x.conv2.shortcut, conv2x.1.conv.shortcut, conv4x.1.conv.shortcut, conv4xd2.0.conv.shortcut, conv4xd2.1.conv.shortcut18040 4626 24532484[94mInitiating train phase ...[0m
